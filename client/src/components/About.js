      <h1>Get ready for LiftOff!</h1>
      <p>
        LiftOff is a social media app designed for children, between the ages of
        8-10 years old, meant to introduce users to the world of social media!
        LiftOff was created as a stepping stone for children to learn
        fundamental digital citizenship skills, such as safety, respect, and
        critical thinking, in order to partake in social media responsibly. At
        LiftOff, we encourage our users to participate with intention. We want
        users to be aware, and in control of, how much time they are spending on
        social media, as well as how their actions online impact others.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        We hope that once users are ready for other social media sites, they
        will be prepared to participate appropriately wherever they go.
      </p>{" "}
      <h3>
        In order to gain these skills, users will move through the following
        levels:
      </h3>{" "}
      <h4>Earthling</h4>{" "}
      <p>
        Immediately after registering, earthlings will be prompted to complete a
        quiz to unlock the app. Users will need to select the most appropriate
        comment from a list based on the photo. This is to get earthlings
        thinking about appropriate comments!
      </p>{" "}
      <h4>Mini Martian</h4>{" "}
      <p>
        Upon registering, users will begin with limited capabilities as a Mini
        Martian. Mini Martians are able to view posts created by other users,
        but will not be able to post or freely comment just yet. As a Mini
        Martian, the goal is to identify appropriate comments - both from
        others, as well as how to comment appropriately. We want users to ask
        themselves why they are commenting. Is the comment kind? Is it true? Is
        it necessary? Mini Martians will have the opportunity to create comments
        which will be approved by the Supreme Leader administrator. Once an
        earthling creates 10 approved comments, they will level up to “Moon
        Walker”
      </p>{" "}
      <h4>Moon Walker</h4>{" "}
      <p>
        Moon Walkers have full commenting privileges! They also have the ability
        to create a post, which will need to be approved by the Supreme Leader
        administrator. Moon Walkers have more freedom on the app; however, if
        Moon Walkers are found to not be following the community guidelines,
        they may be leveled down to a Mini Martian.
      </p>{" "}
      <h4>Are you ready?</h4>
      T-Minus 3, 2, 1… LiftOff!
