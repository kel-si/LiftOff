          Never share any personal information. Information that should be kept
          private are things like:
        </ul>
        <li>Your full name</li>
        <li>Where you live</li>
        <li>Where you go to school</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your password</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>

        <ul>
          When you are posting a photo make sure you don't include any private
          information by accident like:
        </ul>
        <li>Your school or school uniform</li>
        <li>Your house or your street</li>
        <li>
          Post a photo of a place after you leave (you don't want to show your
          current location!)
        </li>
        <p className="highlight--text">
          Make sure to communicate with a parent or guardian about your social
          media use! If something is making you feel uncomfortable, tell a
          trusted adult right away!
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, anything you put on social media is available for anyone to
          see!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text--title">Be Respectful</h2>
        <ul>When you post or commennt, make sure it is respectful!</ul>
        <li>
          Is it kind? Think about how your post or comment might make others
          feel. How would this post or comment make you feel?
        </li>
        <li>Is it true? Posting things that we know are false is not okay.</li>
        <li>
          Is it necessary? We don't want to spam our fellow Mini Martians and
          Moon Walkers with comments or posts. Commenting because we want to
          share kind words, or share something related is awesome!
        </li>
        <h2 className="text--title">Be Mindful</h2>
        <ul>Think about how you are using social media!</ul>
        <li>
          How much time are you on your phone, tablet, or computer? Set a
          timelimit for yourself and stick to it!
